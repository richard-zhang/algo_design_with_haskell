-- key takeaway
-- left to right seems to be natural but most computation are done from right to left (foldr)
-- concat implementation using foldr is more efficient than the previous
-- orginaizing piles of document examples

-- foldl/r different - direction of travel
-- result in 1. wokrking on infinite list? 2. solving problems?

-- online algorithm - scanl
-- online algorithm - owrking on infinite streams of objects, the solution will work on every prefix of the stream
